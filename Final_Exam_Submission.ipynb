        "An important question in microeconomics is the causal return to additional schooling. A simple regression of later-life earnings on  years of education may give a biased estimate of the causal effect of schooling on earnings because individuals with higher non-schooling determinants of earnings  (like intelligence, drive, family background) might also obtain more schooling. As a result, it is important to account for covariates in the estimation, and possibly to use instrumental variables. One instrumental variables strategy to answer this question, proposed by Angrist and Krueger (1991) is to use the quarter of the year in which an individual was born as an instrument. The logic is that it is somewhat random when in the year a person is born, but individuals born later in the year will on average obtain more schooling. The reason is that compulsory schooling laws require children to stay in school until they turn 16. Since children born later in the year turn 16 later, they will be \"forced\" to stay in school a little longer than children who turn 16 earlier in the school year. Compulsory schooling laws vary somewhat by state, so the instruments are generated by interacting quarter of birth with state of birth.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, when quarter of birth is interacted with state of birth, that generates around 150 instruments, which can lead to problems with many instruments.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this final exam you will use machine learning to estimate the causal effect of years of education on the natural log of an individual's weekly wage. In the shared Econ 484 Google Drive \"datasets\" folder you will find a dataset called \"ak91.csv\" and the associated codebook \"ak91codebook.txt\" that gives some information about each of the variables. The data set is that used by Angrist and Krueger (1991). The outcome variable is the natural log of the weekly wage. The \"treatment\" variable is years of education. Instruments are indicators for quarter of birth and their interactions with state of birth. Additional covariates are age, marital status, region of residence, race, urban residence status, and state of birth indicators."
